        <h1>What is covid-19 or SARS-CoV-2?</h1>

        <h4>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses known for containing strains that cause potentially deadly diseases in mammals and birds.<br><br><br>

            In humans they're typically spread via airborne droplets of fluid produced by infected individuals.<br><br><br>


            Of the seven coronaviruses kown to infect humans, four spread with seasonal regularity, causing anything from mild cold-like symptoms to flu-like discomforts.<br><br><br>

            A few more notable strains, including SARS-CoV-2 (responsible for COVID-19), and those responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), can cause death in humans. The cause of death is complex, though is typically the result of heightened immune responses causing damage in multiple systems throughout the body.</h4><br><br><br>

        <h2>Why is it called a coronavirus?</h2><br><br>
        <h4>
            First described in detail in the 1960s, the coronavirus gets its name from a distinctive corona or 'crown' of sugary-proteins that projects from the envelope surrounding the particle. Encoding the virus's make-up is the longest genome of any RNA-based virus – a single strand of nucleic acid roughly 26,000 to 32,000 bases long. <br><br><br>

            There are four known genuses in the family, named Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. The first two only infect mammals, including bats, pigs, cats, and humans. Gammacoronavirus mostly infects birds such as poultry, while Deltacoronavirus can infect both birds and mammals.</h4><br><br><br>

        <h2>What are the symptoms of a coronavirus?</h2><br><br>
        <h4>
            Coronaviruses can give rise to a variety of symptoms in different animals. In a high percentage of cases, infection causes no symptoms at all. These individuals can still easily spread the virus without knowing they're infected.<br><br><br>

            While some strains cause diarrhoea in pigs and in turkeys, in humans infections are usually compared to a bad cold, causing mild to moderate upper respiratory problems such as a runny nose and sore throat.</h4>

        <h4>SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious in humans. As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV).</h4>

        <h4>The Delta Plus variant is a mutant version of B.1.617.2 strain, which was called Delta by the World Health Organisation. Experts say the Delta strain drove the second wave of COVID-19, infecting millions and leading to the deaths of thousands. What the government says on Delta Plus<br><br><br>

            More than 30 crore vaccine doses provided by Centre to states/UTs: Health ministry<br><br><br>

            NEW DELHI: Around 40 cases of the Delta plus variant, classified as a variant of concern (VOC), have been detected sporadically in Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday.<br><br><br>
            The govt has written to these states to take up immediate containment measures in the districts where Delta Plus variant, categorized as a 'Variant of Concern', has been detected.
            The highly infectious Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of Covid-19 that first surfaced in India is feared to have mutated into a more virulent version called AY.1 or Delta Plus — one that is possibly capable of resisting even the monoclonal antibodies cocktail currently being prescribed as a cure.<br><br>
            Here is all you need to know about Delta Plus:<br><br>
            The new Delta plus variant has been formed due to a mutation in the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant.<br><br>
            There is no indication yet of the severity of the disease due to the new variant.<br><br>
            Delta Plus (AY.1) is resistant to monoclonal antibodies cocktail<br><br>
            It is not yet a variant of concern (VoC) in India, due to low incidence.<br><br>
            One of the emerging variants is B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1 is characterized by the acquisition of K417N mutation.<br><br>
            The mutation is in the spike protein of SARS-COV-2, which helps the virus enter and infect the human cells.<br><br>
            63 genomes of Delta (B.1.617.2) with the new K417N mutation have been identified by the GISAID so far.<br><br><br>
            Delta plus was present in six genomes from India as of June 7, as per Public Health England (PHE).<br><br>
            The variant frequency for K417N is not much in India at this point in time. The sequences are mostly from Europe, Asia and America.<br><br>
            The earliest sequence of this genome was found in Europe in late March this year.<br><br>
            Delta Plus cases in India and world<br><br><br>
            As per Public Health England (PHE), an executive agency of the UK government's health and social care department, 63 genomes of Delta (B.1.617.2) with the new K417N mutation had been identified so far on the global science initiative GISAID.
